# Krono Engine

## Idea

This is (or rather will be) a 2-D game engine with a focus on time-based gameplay.
Inspired by Chrono Trigger's time travel mechanic, and with a desire for more games to implement a time travel feature that actually affects the game's world and story, this engine was conceived.
